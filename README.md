# **Object_detection_RaspberryPi  ðŸ¦±**


[![Optional Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://shields.io)  Uses various models and algorithms to detect faces on respberry pi.

## **Features**

* **Optimized to Run on Respberry pi**.
* **Converted Models into TFLite**. 
* **Low inference time and increase fps**.

## **Getting Started**

1. Dependencies used - opencv , yolo, ultralytics, tensorflow, tflite , pandas .
2. Also used yolo for live face recognition and comparision.
3. LabelImg is used to label the images for training the yolo model.
   


## **Usage ðŸ¦³**
1. ***Hardware Setup: Connect your camera module following the official Raspberry Pi instructions.***
2. ***Software Setup: Clone your project, navigate to the directory, and install any additional libraries (pip3 install <library_name>).***
3. **Train or Run: Train your model with your own dataset , then locate and run the main script (python3 <script_name>.py).***
4. ***Output: The program displays a live camera feed with bounding boxes around detected faces. If trained, recognized faces will be labeled.***
