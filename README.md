**Explanation:**

* Lines starting with `#` are headings. You can use `##` for subheadings and so on. Bold text is achieved with `**text**`.
* Image display uses the following syntax: `![Alt text](path/to/image.png)`. Make sure to replace the placeholder text and path with your actual information. The path can be relative (if the image is in the same folder as the README) or absolute (a URL pointing to the image).
    * **Important:**  For images stored within your repository, use the following format to ensure proper rendering on GitHub:

    ```markdown
    ![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<username>/<repo name>/<branch>/path/to/image.png)
    ```

    Replace `<username>`, `<repo name>`, `<branch>`, and `<path to image.png>` with your specific details.

* This is a basic structure, feel free to add more sections like "Known Issues," "Changelog," etc.

**Tips:**

* Use emojis to make your README more visually appealing.  Search online for "[https://www.freetool.dev/emoji-picker](https://www.freetool.dev/emoji-picker)" to find options.
* Keep your README concise and informative. 
* Proofread your README carefully before publishing your project.
